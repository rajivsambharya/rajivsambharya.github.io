I am a third year PhD student in the [Operations Research and Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu) department at Princeton (started in Fall 2019).  My research focuses on using data-driven techniques to solve mathematical optimization and control problems.  Some specific interests include semidefinite programming, robust optimization, and differentiable optimization.  My advisor is [Bartolomeo Stellato](https://stellato.io).

My email is rajivs [at] princeton.edu. Here is my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2FZJ820AAAAJ&hl=en) page and my [CV]({{rajivsambharya.github.io}}/files/CV.pdf).
